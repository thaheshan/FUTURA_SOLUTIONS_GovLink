## 🛠️ How This Docs Folder Was Built

All documentation is:
- ✅ Written in **Markdown** for clarity and GitHub rendering
- ✅ Organized by **purpose** (planning, design, implementation, user, API)
- ✅ Linked from the **main README.md** for easy access
- ✅ Designed to support **GitHub Pages** (optional live site)

> 💡 Tip: This `docs/README.md` helps anyone landing here understand where to go — just like a **table of contents** for your hackathon story.

## 🎯 Final Goal

This documentation proves that **GovLink** is not just a prototype — it’s a:
- ✅ **Well-designed** solution
- ✅ **Well-documented** system
- ✅ **Production-ready** platform

Ready to transform how Sri Lankans access government services.
