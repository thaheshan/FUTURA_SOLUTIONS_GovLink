# ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement

There is no **unified, transparent, and mobile-friendly platform** for Sri Lankan citizens to access government services like NIC reissue, birth registration, or land records.

Current challenges:
- No real-time tracking of application status
- Lack of centralized digital records
- Inefficient appointment booking
- High dependency on physical visits
- Limited accessibility for rural or elderly users

This results in **weeks-long processing times**, **citizen frustration**, and **inefficient resource use** by government staff.
