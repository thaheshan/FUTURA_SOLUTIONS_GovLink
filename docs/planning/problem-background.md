# 📌 Problem Background

In Sri Lanka, accessing government services (e.g., NIC reissue, birth registration) is often a **time-consuming, paper-based, and inefficient process**.

Citizens face:
- 🕒 Long waiting times
- 🏃 Multiple office visits
- 📄 Manual form filling
- ❌ No real-time tracking
- 🔐 Low transparency

Government officials are burdened with:
- 📚 Paperwork overload
- 📅 Manual appointment logs
- 🔍 Difficulty tracking application status
- 💬 Poor communication with applicants

This outdated system leads to **low citizen satisfaction**, **high administrative costs**, and **delays in service delivery**.

GovLink aims to **digitize and modernize** this process using mobile technology, real-time tracking, and automated workflows.
